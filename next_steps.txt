NEXT STEPS BASED ON LATEST ANALYSIS:
====================================

1. PATTERN FOUND:
   - q values show divisibility by 3, 4, 5, 8, 15, 24
   - Numbers 8, 15, 24 appear (15 and 24 are A5 conjugacy class sizes)
   - Neutrinos fit well in 4D representation: q = -10.43*w - 192.14

2. ISSUES:
   - No single linear model works for all particles
   - Different particle types may need different formulas

3. NEW HYPOTHESES:
   a) q = k1*(dim^2-1) + k2*spin + k3*charge + k4*isospin + ...
   b) Different representations have different formulas
   c) The model might be quadratic, not linear

4. IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS:
   a) Try q = a*(dim^2-1) + b*spin + c*charge + d
   b) Include electric charge and isospin in the model
   c) Try separate models for fermions and bosons
   d) Check if q/4 (n) has better mathematical properties

5. LONGER TERM:
   a) Understand why 8 appears (not a conjugacy class size)
   b) Look for connections to E8 or other larger groups
   c) Re-examine the original paper's matrix approach with corrections

TO DO NOW:
1. Create a script that includes all known quantum numbers
2. Try multivariate regression with dim, spin, charge, isospin
3. Check predictions for neutrino masses more carefully
