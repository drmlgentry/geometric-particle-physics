\section{Discussion and Testable Predictions}

The lattice structure predicts additional allowed mass sites not currently occupied
by known particles.
These sites define narrow mass windows for potential new fermions or composite states.

Unlike many beyond-Standard-Model scenarios, the present framework makes
\emph{quantitative} predictions with no tunable parameters.
Failure to observe states within these windows would falsify the model.

Future work should investigate:
\begin{itemize}
\item Extension to neutrino mass eigenstates
\item Coupling of the lattice to modular flavor symmetries
\item Dynamical mechanisms generating lattice occupation
\end{itemize}

The framework is compatible with existing collider constraints and offers a
conceptually new approach to the flavor problem.
