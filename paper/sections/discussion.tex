\section{Discussion}

Discrete non-Abelian symmetries such as $A_4$, $S_4$, and $A_5$ have been extensively studied in the context of fermion mixing and neutrino oscillations. The present work differs fundamentally in that it addresses absolute mass values rather than mixing angles, revealing a previously unexplored domain of applicability for discrete flavor symmetries.

The principal limitation of the model is its kinematic nature. While the lattice accurately organizes observed masses, it does not yet explain the dynamical origin of the structure. This limitation, however, is common to early-stage phenomenological frameworks and does not diminish the empirical significance of the discovery.

A central strength of the approach is its falsifiability. The lattice contains systematically unoccupied sites corresponding to sharply defined mass windows. The discovery or exclusion of particles within these windows provides a direct experimental test. In contrast to many beyond–Standard Model scenarios, the predictions are discrete and highly constrained.

Future theoretical developments may embed the lattice structure within a more fundamental framework, potentially involving modular symmetries, grand unified theories with discrete remnants, or geometric structures in field space. Regardless of the ultimate origin, the existence of the mass lattice itself constitutes a new empirical regularity that any complete theory of particle masses must explain.
