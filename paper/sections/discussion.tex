The proposed mass lattice framework differs fundamentally from traditional
flavor models. Rather than assigning representations to generations, it derives
mass structure from geometric necessity.

The model naturally explains why Yukawa couplings appear finely tuned: they are
effective parameters encoding deeper geometric relations. Radiative stability
follows from the exponential structure of the lattice.

Experimental implications include the prediction of new fermionic states at
specific mass intervals, as well as constraints on mass ratios that can be
tested with improved precision measurements.
