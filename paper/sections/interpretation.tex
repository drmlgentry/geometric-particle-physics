\section{Interpretation}

The emergence of near-integer logarithmic mass indices suggests that fermion masses
are not arbitrary but arise from an underlying discrete organizing principle.
The appearance of the golden ratio is not imposed but emerges naturally from the
$A_5$ symmetry structure.

Within this framework, fermion generations correspond to successive lattice layers,
while inter-sector mass ratios reflect distinct irreducible embeddings.
This interpretation unifies mass hierarchies and flavor structure within a single
geometric picture.

Importantly, the construction is insensitive to ultraviolet model details and does
not rely on specific Yukawa textures, making it robust against unknown high-energy physics.
