The emergence of a logarithmic mass lattice indicates that fermion masses are
quantized with respect to an internal geometric coordinate. This quantization
is not imposed by gauge symmetry, but by discrete geometric consistency.

The role of $A_5$ suggests that internal symmetry groups act as holonomy groups
for this space, determining allowed mass trajectories. In this sense, fermion
masses resemble eigenvalues of a geometric operator rather than free parameters.

This framework provides a conceptual bridge between discrete group theory,
geometry, and particle phenomenology, without invoking additional dimensions or
continuous moduli.
