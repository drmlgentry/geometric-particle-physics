\section{Future Directions and Testable Predictions}

The mass lattice predicts the existence of particles corresponding to unoccupied lattice sites. These states are associated with specific logarithmic indices $q$ and therefore sharply constrained mass ranges.

Prominent predicted regions include:
\begin{itemize}
\item light neutral fermions in the sub-GeV to few-GeV range,
\item electroweak-scale states accessible at the LHC,
\item heavier states relevant to future high-energy colliders.
\end{itemize}

On the theoretical side, future work should explore:
\begin{enumerate}
\item extensions of the lattice to fermion mixing matrices,
\item connections with modular and hyperbolic symmetries,
\item dynamical mechanisms capable of generating the lattice structure.
\end{enumerate}

The mass lattice provides a compact, falsifiable target for both experimental and theoretical investigation.
