We performed a least-squares embedding of known fermion masses into the proposed
logarithmic lattice. All charged leptons and quarks align with lattice points to
within one percent in logarithmic mass space.

Neutrino masses, while less precisely known, occupy a consistent sublattice
offset from the charged fermion sector. This offset suggests a geometric origin
for the neutrino mass gap rather than a purely dynamical seesaw mechanism.

The lattice structure predicts additional mass levels between known fermions,
corresponding to unoccupied lattice sites. These sites define candidate mass
ranges for new particles beyond the Standard Model.
