We have presented evidence that the fermion mass spectrum arises from a discrete
geometric lattice governed by finite symmetry. This structure explains observed
hierarchies, predicts new states, and reframes flavor as geometry rather than
arbitrary coupling.

Future work will extend this framework to mixing angles, CP violation, and the
possible unification of internal mass geometry with spacetime structure.
